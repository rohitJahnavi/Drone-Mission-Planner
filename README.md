import numpy as np

* This imports the NumPy library and assigns it the alias np.
* NumPy provides efficient array operations and mathematical functions, making it useful for numerical computations.
  
import heapq

* This imports the heapq module, which provides a priority queue (min-heap) implementation.
* It is useful for implementing algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path algorithm or A search*, where we need to efficiently retrieve the smallest element.

  
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

* This imports the pyplot module from the matplotlib library and assigns it the alias plt.
* matplotlib.pyplot is used for plotting 2D and 3D graphs, creating visualizations, and displaying data.

  
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

* This imports Axes3D from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d, enabling 3D plotting with Matplotlib.
* Without this, matplotlib cannot render 3D plots.
